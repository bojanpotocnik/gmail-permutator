# Gmail Address Permutator

Simple async script to permutate dots (*.*) in the original Gmail address, eventually appending plus (*+*) for easier filtering of the email. 

Useful for various giveaways, prize contests, etc. where the identity is assumed only according to the email. This script can generate "infinity" of email addresses from one single base address, and all of them are real, delivering mail to one single destination Gmail inbox.

> ## Dots don't matter in Gmail addresses
> If someone accidentally adds dots to your address when emailing you, you'll still get that email. For example, if your email is johnsmith@gmail.com, you own all dotted versions of your address:
> - **john.smith@gmail.com**
> - **jo.hn.sm.ith@gmail.com**
> - **j.o.h.n.s.m.i.t.h@gmail.com**
>
> **Note:** If you use Gmail through work, school, or other organization (like yourdomain.com or yourschool.edu), dots do change your address. To change the dots in your username, contact your admin.

Moreover,
> - Append a plus ("+") sign and any combination of words or numbers after your email address. For example, if your name was hikingfan@gmail.com, you could send mail to hikingfan+friends@gmail.com or hikingfan+mailinglists@gmail.com.
> 
> ... the real value in being able to manipulate your email address is that it makes it really easy to filter on those variants. For example you could use hikingfan+bank@gmail.com when you sign up for online banking and then set up a filter to automatically star, archive or label emails addressed to hikingfan+bank. You can also use this when you register for a service and think they might share your information. For example, I added "+donation" when I gave money to a political organization once, and now when I see emails from other groups to that address, I know how they got it. Solution: filtered to auto-delete.
